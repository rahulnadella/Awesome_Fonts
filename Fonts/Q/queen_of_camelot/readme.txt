Long Live the Queen! Greetings friends. This is a rework of an older font project "Jolly Raunchy". This version contains more visually appealing glyphs with proportionate weights and kerning
added. Punctuation is included as is basic latin, some ligatures, and diacritics for Eastern Europe. Extended latin can be added upon purchase of a commercial license. 
Contact me for more info on this. Lowercase letters mirror Uppercase as well which works well for titles, logos, and branding. 

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license.
If you've previously licensed the older version you're grandfathered into this version. Thank you! I also design custom fonts for businesses, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to 
leave me a donation you can use the same address via paypal. Your generosity will be most appreciated! Enjoy!
